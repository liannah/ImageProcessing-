Working on the pciture 59-11 for the stage1. 


f01 - pixels around the face bounds 

Applying the plugin binary_Layer_0 does not produce a good result, as intead of finding the boundaries of the face, it highlights 
the skin as evidenced with dark colors in the skin area. Picture name - 59-11_Binary_Layer_0_FirstAttempt. 

Thus, tried to apply Gaussian blur with 2.00 radius and than apply plugin0. The result was some or less better, but still the skin area of the face was noticeably selected instead of boundary. Picture - 59-11-Binary_Layer_0_SecondAttempt.

The next I have tried to apply maximum filter with 5 radius, than gaussian blur with 1 radius, after plugin0. The result was as seen in the picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_0_ThirdAttempt. Again not satisfactory result with skin of the face majorly selected. 

Next attempt - Gaussian blur with 2 radius, maximum filter with 10 radius, gaussian blur with 2 radius, plugin0. The result agais is not satisfactory with hair boundaries all gone, and skin selected, however, the boundaries till the hair are very nicely highloghted. Picture - 59-11-Binary_Layer_0_FourthAttempt.  

Next attempt - 6.5 maximum filter, 8 gaussian blur, plugin0. The picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_0_FifthAttempt. 

Next Attempt - 6.5 maximum filter, 8 gaussian blur, plugin 0, maximum filter 1 radius. The picture - 59-11-Binary_Layer_0_SixthAttempt.  


-------------------------------------------------------------------


f12 - the majority of skin pixels. 

First attempt - plugin1 (Binary_Layer_1). The result is quite satisfactory with mainly skin area selected. Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_1_FirstAttempt. 

Next attempt - plugin1, minimum filter with 0.5 radius. Picture 
59-11-Binary_Layer_1_SecondAttempt - smoother and more vivid selection of skin pixels.
 
Next Attempt - gaussian blur 3.50 radius, unsharp mask with 3.0 radius and 0.90 mask weight, plugin1. The picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_1_ThirdAttempt.
 
Next Attempt - gaussian blur 2.0 radius, plugin1. The picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_1_FourthAttempt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

f23  - pixels from central region around the nose 

First attempt - plugin2 (Binary_Layer_2). The result is mediocre, as even though the nose, eyes, mouth are selected, the ears and neck pixels also are visible. Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_2_FirstAttempt

Next Attempt - Gaussian blur with 2.0 radius, and plugin2. 
The result is mediocre again and less satisfactory, because even
though we can see smoothness, the selected central parts are not fully visible. Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_2_SecondAttempt.

Next Attempt - gaussian blur with 1.0 radius, unsharp mask with 2 radius and mask weight 0.3, plugin2. Better result than second attempt as better visibilty in mouth  and nose. Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_2_ThirdAttempt. 

Next Attempt - unsharp mask with 4 radius and mask weight 0.3, plugin2. The result is better in terms of nose, mouth and eyes, however the neck part pixels also got "better". Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_2_FourthAttempt.



-----------------------------------------------------------------

f34 - pixels from lips and ears 

First attempt - plugin3 (Binary_Layer_3). The result is not bad, the shapes of lips is not visible but some marks are pressent, the same can apply for ears. Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_3_FirstAttempt.

Next Attempt - gaussian blur with 2.0 radius, unsharp mask with 6 radius and mask weight 0.5, plugin2. The result is good, even some part of nose is also selected and ears are not smooth. Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_3_SecondAttempt. 

Next Attempt - mean 2.0, median 2.0, gaussian blur 1.0, unsharp mask with 5 radius and mask weight 0.3, plugin2. The result not satisfactory. Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_3_ThirdAttempt. 

Next Attempt - minimum filter with 3.0 radius, plugin2, minimum filter with 1.0 radius. Picture 59-11-Binary_Layer_3_FourthAttempt.

Working on the picture 60-11 for the Stage1.

f01 


First attempt - applying plugin0. The result is not satisfactory with skin the face area (skin) noticably selected with hair pixels. 
Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_0_FirstAttempt. 

Second Attempt - Maximum filter with 5.0, and gaussian blur with 3.0 radius, plugin0. The result worsens with face and hair pixels selected the same if not worse way. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_0_SecondAttempt.

Third attempt - gaussian blur 1.0, maximum filter with 3.0, and unsharp mask with 3 radius and mask weight 0.6, plugin0, maximum filter 1.0 radius. The result is again not very satisfactory, as I have tried to apply one more time the maximum filter to lessen the pixels at the face area. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_0_ThirdAttempt.


Fourth Attempt - gaussian blur 3.0, maximum filter 5.0, mean 2.0, unsharp mask with 4 radius and mask weight 0.6, plugin0, maximum filter 3.0. The result is somewhat better. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_0_FourthAttempt. 

Fifth Attempt - gaussian blur 2, maximum filter 6, unsharp mask with 4 radius and mask weight 0.7, plugin0, maximum filter 4.0. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_0_FifthAttempt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

f12 

First attempt - plugin1. The result is not good and I would say opposite to what expected. Looks like what would we had expected from plugin0 and the same can be said about plugin0 in an attempt w=one it did what should plugin1 do. Picture Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_1_FirstAttempt.

Second attempt - gaussian blur 3.0, mimimum filter 4.0, plugin1. Not a good result. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_1_SecondAttempt.

Third attempt - mean , median , minimum filter 3.0, plugin1. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_1_ThirdAttempt.   


-------------------------------------------------------------------

f23

First attempt - plugin2. The result is not bad, with mouse perfectly shown, the nose and eyes somewhat present. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_2_FirstAttempt. 

Second attempt - unsharp mask with 2.0 radius and 0.3 weight, the gaussian blur with 2.0, plugin2, and minimum filter . Mediocre result. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_2_SecondAttempt. 

Third attempt - unsharp mask with 4.0 radius and 0.3 weight, plugin2. The result is quite good. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_2_ThirdAttempt.  


-------------------------------------------------------------------

f34

First attempt - plugin3. Only lips no ears. However the result is reasonable as no ears can be detected from long hair. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_3_FirstAttempt.

Second attempt - minimum filter with 3 radius, unsharp mask with 3.0 radius and 0.3 weight, plugin3. Nice result. Picture 60-11-Binary_Layer_3_SecondAttempt.

If not achieved the result immediately after applying plugins ->

Conclusion - 

f01 - gaussian blur, maximum filter, unsharp mask, plugin0, if necessary one more time maximum filter.

The reasoning behind is that we need to sharpen the edges which should be a little darker than the background part, thus to get it we need to blur the message and apply maximum filter to get the maximum pixels of surrounding, afterwards unsharp the image to make the edges more noticable and than apply plugin0.  

f12 - gaussian blur, minimum filter, plugin1. 

The reasoning behind is to blur the image to get more smoothened picture, afterwards apply minimum filter to get the minimum pixels of the surrounding trying to guarantee that skin area will be more noticable by the algorithm, and than apply algorithm of plugin1. 


f23 - unsharp mask with higher than 0.3 weight, plugin2. 

The reasoning behind is to get the unsharp edges as much as possible before applying plugin2. 


f34 - minimum filter (optional), unsharp mask with less than 0.4 weight. 

The reasoning behind is to again get the unsharp edges as noticable as possible for the algorithm.
